homeBudget
==========



This is my final project created in Symfony on CodersLab Course Become Back-End Developer.
I use FOSUserBundle to manage with logging and creating user's accounts.
Now it gives basic functionality to run Your home budget. You can add, remove and
modify accounts, incomes and spends. I'm still working on it and trying to improve my project.
